In many of my everyday tasks, I rely on Bash to carry out Linux commands and create certain logical processes. While Bash’s capabilities are impressive, it’s important to note that since it deals with low-level operations within the operating system, it can sometimes escalate minor problems ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Learning and Takeaways from Kubesimplify Workshop</title><link href="https://samueltyh.github.io/posts/learning-and-takeaways-from-kubesimplify-workshop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning and Takeaways from Kubesimplify Workshop" /><published>2022-08-07T00:03:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-08-08T23:12:49+02:00</updated> <id>https://samueltyh.github.io/posts/learning-and-takeaways-from-kubesimplify-workshop/</id> <content src="https://samueltyh.github.io/posts/learning-and-takeaways-from-kubesimplify-workshop/" /> <author> <name>Samuel Tseng</name> </author> <category term="Data Engineering Learning Journey" /> <summary> This post will keep the learning process and takeaways from the Kubesimplify workshops held by Saiyam Pathak. The motivation for me to catch up on this DevOps topic is to systematically learning by practising for DevOps mindset, in order to achieve double blade stacks, facilitating Data Engineering tasks and projects via DevOps approaches.
